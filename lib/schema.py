"""Extract a data model from whatever the repo uses to define one — DDL, ORM models, migrations.

Same argument as the code map, applied to tables. An agent asked "where are refunds stored" will
otherwise either guess or ask for a schema dump, and a dump of a real schema is thousands of tokens
of column definitions to answer a question about one table name.

Two tiers, and the second is deliberately NOT a vector store:

  small schema  -> table names and one-line summaries go into the session, all of them
  large schema  -> only the names go in; columns stay in the map's detail section, grepped

Vector search over schema metadata is a real technique and it would work here, but it needs an
embedding model, which means a dependency or a network call in a plugin that currently has neither.
Grep reaches the same place: the agent knows the table exists from the injected name list, then
greps one heading for its columns. The saving comes from not injecting all the columns, and both
approaches deliver that.

Nothing here connects to a database. It reads the files that describe one.

    # section, both fixed from the same diagnosis (R5 acc3).
    #
    # And the cliff was INVERTED, which is why nobody noticed: 41 tables took the names-only branch
    # and cost 674 tokens while 40 took the detailed one and cost 3,866. The "large schema" path was
    # already the cheap one.

    # Falling back to names-only rather than to a handful of detailed rows, because a budget cut
    # that names 5 of 40 tables is worse than one that names all 40 without their summaries —
