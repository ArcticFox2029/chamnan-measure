"""Portable architecture map — the language-agnostic version of claude_system/tools/map_architecture.py.

The original works and is measured (context read per API call fell 22.6% on this machine after
claude_system landed, holding the model constant), but it is welded to this repo: it parses Python
with `ast`, globs `src/*.py`, and special-cases one filename. None of that transfers.

This one takes the same idea to any repository. The trade it makes is deliberate: per-language AST
parsing does not scale past one or two languages, so everything except Python is read with regex.
That is approximate on purpose. A map is a NAVIGATION INDEX, not a compiler front-end — it has to
answer "which file do I open for X" in a few hundred tokens. Missing an edge-case declaration costs
one grep; being unmaintainable across six languages costs the whole tool.

Output has the same two-part shape as the original, and the shape is the point:

  QUICK INDEX  — one line per file. Small enough to read in full, every session.
  FULL DETAIL  — per-file symbols. Never read whole; grepped for the one heading you need.

On this repo the index is 10% of the file, so the habit "read the index, grep the detail" is what
actually saves the context, not the file existing.

  python3 lib/mapper.py <repo> [--out PATH] [--measure]

That is this module's own entry point, and its flags are not the plugin command's: chamnan-map
takes --preview, --explain and --install-git-hook. It also accepts --measure without erroring, but
that is only so the name is not rejected as unknown — it is not wired to this module's --measure
output above, and running it prints the same thing plain `chamnan-map` does.

Never imports or executes the code it reads.

# 🐛 [2026-09-06] The byte ceiling assumes cost is roughly proportional to file SIZE, and for

# wrong by three orders of magnitude, because `ast.parse` allocates per STATEMENT, not per byte.
# Measured on this machine, one file, through `scan()`:
#

    `_CASCADE_MIN_ROUND_S…`, `tools/preflig…`, `call_ollama_chat's q…`. That is the worst place to
    cut: identifiers are what sessions actually search for (measured here: 51.1% of the identifiers
    this repository's sessions searched for are answerable from MAP.md), and half an identifier
    matches nothing. Backing up to the last space costs a handful of bytes and keeps the token whole.

    Bounded, because the fix has its own failure mode: a single long unbroken token near the limit
    would otherwise shrink the description by however long it is. Past CLIP_BACKOFF the hard cut
    stands and the token is broken -- worse, but bounded.

    **`limit` is in CHARACTERS on purpose, and this has been decided twice.** `lib/tokens.py` exists
    because a character budget mis-prices any script that is not mostly Latin, and this looks like
    the same defect -- a research round has now reported it as one twice, which is why the reasoning
    is written HERE rather than only in a commit message nobody reads.
    
    Measured on this repository's own estimator: an English description of 93 characters is 38.3
    tokens, an equivalent Thai one of 82 characters is 65.7. A token cap set to the English figure
    would cut that Thai description at 45 characters of 82 -- it would lose half a sentence to make a
    number tidy. The Chinese case is worse: 31 characters carry 27.6 tokens, and the suite pins
    `A CHINESE LEADING COMMENT REACHES THE INDEX INTACT` precisely because that comment must survive
    whole.
    
    The difference from the budgets `tokens.py` was built for is what settles it. Those bound a
    SECTION that is injected into every session, where overspending costs the reader something. This
    bounds ONE ROW of a file that is read on demand and grepped, where the cost of cutting early is
    an identifier nobody can find and the cost of a long row is nothing. When the two disagree,
    keeping the sentence wins.

    CPython's parser NFKC-normalises non-ASCII identifiers before `ast` ever sees them (PEP 3131),
    so `node.name` is not always what the file spells. Thai's SARA AM (U+0E33) is the common case:
    it normalises to NIKHAHIT + SARA AA, two codepoints for one, so a name that is 9 codepoints in
    the source comes back 10 codepoints long from `ast` -- visually identical, and a literal `grep`
    for either spelling misses the other. MAP.md's own header tells the reader to grep it, so this
    silently broke the documented workflow.

    `node.lineno`/`node.col_offset` name the exact `def`/`class` keyword regardless -- normalisation
    only touches the identifier text, not where the parser says it starts. `col_offset` is a UTF-8
    BYTE offset, not a character offset, so the line is encoded before slicing and decoded after;
    slicing the `str` directly would cut mid-character on any line with non-ASCII text before the
    keyword (a preceding decorator never applies -- it is always a separate node on its own line).

    The name is then walked off one character at a time, using `str.isidentifier()` -- the same
    XID_Start/XID_Continue rule the parser itself used to accept it -- rather than a regex class,
    because no fixed regex character class matches exactly what CPython accepts as an identifier.

    Falls back to `node.name` if the source line cannot be re-read (should not happen for a node
    `ast` just produced from this exact `source`, but a fallback beats a crash on a well-formed
    file for something that is a display nicety, not correctness-critical).

    The same PEP 3131 normalisation applies here — `def คำนวณ(จำนวน)` came back with the parameter
    spelled `จํานวน`, ten codepoints where the source has nine, so a reader grepping MAP.md for the

# 🐛 Every table above spelled an identifier `\w`, and `\w` in Python's `re` does not match the
# Mn/Mc categories — combining marks. `ชื่อ` is four codepoints of which two are marks, so it is
# not a `\w+` match, and an ordinary Thai method name was invisible in TWELVE languages. Measured
# with one name in each, before and after:
#
#     go c js ts rs php kotlin java cs swift sh   ราคา found      ชื่อ NOTHING
#     rb                                          ราคา found      ชื่อ -> `ช`   (truncated!)
#
# Ruby's is the worse outcome of the two: `[^\W\d]\w*` starts correctly and then stops at the
# first mark, so the index published a one-character name that is not the method's name — a fix I
# landed for Ruby last round that traded invisibility for a wrong answer.
#
# **And the commit that landed it said the opposite.** It recorded "measured across seven languages
# with the same Thai method name: go, c, js, rs, php and kotlin all found it; only Ruby did not, so
# this is one gap rather than the 'fixed in some members of a set' shape it looked like." That
# conclusion was an artefact of the name chosen for the test: `ราคา` has no combining marks, and
# with one that does, every language fails. Tenth occurrence of that shape here, ruled out by a
# measurement that could not see it.
#
# Rewritten over the WHOLE table in one pass rather than pattern by pattern, which is the only
# form of this fix that cannot be applied to some languages and forgotten in others. The scanner
# tracks whether it is inside a character class, because `[\w:]` has to become `[\w<marks>:]` and
# a bare `\w*` has to become `[\w<marks>]*` — substituting the same text in both places produces
# a nested bracket and a pattern that means something else entirely.

# 🐛 [2026-09-06] The instruction said "grep the one heading you need", and a reader following it
# with `grep -A N` gets a SILENTLY truncated answer whenever the section is longer than N. Measured
# on this repository's real index: the median Full Detail section is 10 lines, so `-A 20` returns
# the whole of 285 of 326 files — and cuts the other 41 with nothing saying so. The longest is 472
# lines, and at `-A 20` a reader sees 4% of it and cannot tell (R8 agent 6).
#
# A RANGE read cannot truncate, and it is one line of instruction rather than a number every reader
# has to guess. `grep` is still named first because it is what a reader reaches for and it is right
# for finding WHICH heading; the range is what to use once they know.

    SessionStart injects, and it named none of them: a 2 MB module and a binary behind a `.py`

    this project's own stated position on staleness applied to absence (R12 agent 5).

    did -- 5 of 5 trials -- and every later session on that checkout reported the index "1 minute

    reader to ignore it. The commit hash is what the mtime was standing in for, so it is written
