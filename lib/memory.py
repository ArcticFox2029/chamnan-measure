"""Project memory — why the code is the way it is, kept where the code is.

Three categories, and the split is deliberate rather than decorative:

    decisions/  A choice that was made, and why. "Postgres over SQLite because two writers."
    lessons/    Something that cost time once. "The index looks stale until you remap."
    rules/      A constraint this repository works under. "Never add a Cloud fallback for embeddings."

They differ in how they are used, which is the whole reason they are separate directories. A rule
is a standing constraint that should be in front of the agent before it starts, so rules are
injected. A decision or a lesson is looked up when a particular question comes round, so those
contribute a title and are read on demand -- the same economy skills/ and tools/ already use, and
for the same reason: a registry of names costs a line each and buys the ability to load the right
one, while injecting the bodies costs everything and buys nothing extra.

NOT a conversation log. An entry is written deliberately, by a person or by Claude at their
request, because something was worth keeping. If it can be recovered by reading the code or the
git history, it does not belong here.

**No age-based retention, on purpose.** Session records expire because "where I stopped on the
14th" stops mattering; a decision does not. The reason a database was chosen two years ago is
exactly the thing nobody can reconstruct later, and deleting it on a timer would throw away the
most valuable entries first. Growth is bounded at the INJECTION instead: rules are capped by
characters, titles are capped by count, and the store itself is allowed to grow because these
files are small and each one was written on purpose.
