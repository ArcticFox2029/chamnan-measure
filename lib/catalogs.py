"""Two more index sections, built the same way as the data model: routes, and configuration.

Both follow the rules the whole map follows — one file, sections only when the repo has that thing,
and a bounded size. A repo of plain scripts sees neither of these sections exist.

Routes: an OpenAPI document for a real service runs to thousands of tokens of parameter and response
schemas, to answer a question that is usually "does an endpoint for X exist and where is it
handled". Method, path and handler answer that.

Configuration: VARIABLE NAMES ONLY, NEVER VALUES. This reads .env files, which hold live
credentials. A tool that indexes a codebase must not be the thing that copies a secret into a file
the user then commits, so values are discarded at parse time rather than filtered later — there is
no code path here that can carry one into the output.
