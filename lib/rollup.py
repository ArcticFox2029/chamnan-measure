    """Fold a too-large index down to one line per directory instead of cutting its tail off.

    Truncating at a byte offset drops whatever sorts last, so on a 196-file repo everything from
    roughly `s` onward vanishes from the session with no indication that a whole area of the code
    exists. The agent then greps for it, which is the cost this file is meant to remove.

    A directory roll-up keeps every part of the repo visible at lower resolution: the agent still
    learns that `2dspeak/` and `game/` are there and how big they are, and can read the full entry
    for one of them out of MAP.md. Coarse and complete beats detailed and arbitrarily half-missing.

    WHICH eight filenames survive per directory used to be `sorted(names)[:8]` -- the alphabet,
    which knows nothing about the repo. Measured on this one: of 12,332 re-read events across six
    working sessions, the alphabetical eight named 22.7% of them, git-churn-ranked eight named
    35.6%, and the unreachable oracle that picks with hindsight reaches 57.0%. Ranking by how often
    a file is committed captures over a third of the available headroom for one `git log`.

    `root` is optional and the ranking is a bonus, never a requirement: no git, a shallow clone, or
    a repo under MIN_COMMITS_TO_RANK commits all fall back to the alphabet, which is stable and
    diffs cleanly. Names are always emitted sorted regardless of how they were chosen, so the line
    reads the same way and a re-run does not reshuffle it.

    `per_dir` is how many names each directory line carries. It exists so a caller that is over a
    hard output limit can spend the index's resolution before spending the index: four names still
    orient a reader, and `per_dir=0` still says the directory exists and how big it is. Losing
    resolution is cheaper than losing the section, and much cheaper than losing whatever would have
    been dropped in its place.

    # use, and the reason is the same — past four, a reader is scanning a list rather than reading a
    # sentence, and the count carries the rest. If even that does not fit, the short form does,
    # because a truncated explanation is worse than a general one.

    # 🐛 Sections removed WHOLE were named; a section cut in half was not. This is a prefix cut, so
    # the last heading it keeps is a section that kept its title and lost most of its body — and
    # said nothing about it. Measured: sixty routes selected, twenty-nine delivered, heading intact,
    # no notice, and the section's own "Showing 60 of 5,000" line left standing as a claim about
    # content that is not there.
    #
    # That is quieter than the whole-section drop this note already reports, and worse for the same
    # reason `fit.py` drops sections whole rather than cutting them: a reader can act on "this is
    # missing, go and grep it", and cannot act on a list that looks complete and is not.
