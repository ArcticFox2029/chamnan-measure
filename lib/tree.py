"""One pruned walk of the repository, shared by everything that needs to look at every file.

Measured on a 224-file repository before this existed: `chamnan-map` took 75s, and 31s of that was
`render()` — 26.8s of which was inside `rglob`, across **94,538 calls**. Nine separate full-tree
walks were running per map, one per scanner and several inside per-pattern loops:

    assets.scan        rglob("*")                         19.2s
    deploy.scan        rglob(pattern) per pattern          9.5s
    catalogs.scan_routes rglob(pat) per pattern            7.4s
    catalogs.scan_env  rglob("*.yaml"/"*.yml"/"*.json")    6.2s
    schema             rglob("*.sql"), rglob("*.prisma")
    mapper             rglob(".git"), rglob("*")

Each of them filtered SKIP_DIRS *after* pathlib had already descended, so every one paid the full
cost of `.venv`, `node_modules`, `.git` and any nested checkout before throwing the results away —
and `catalogs` and `schema` had no skip list at all, so a YAML file inside a virtualenv counted as
this repository's configuration.

`os.walk` with in-place pruning of `dirnames` never enters those directories in the first place, and
doing it once and caching means the second scanner pays nothing. This helps the FIRST run as much as
a repeat one, which is why it is the walk that was fixed rather than a cache added on top of it.

Reading every file to hash it, for comparison, costs 0.08s on the same repository — so if an
incremental index is ever built, this is the layer it should sit on, not a replacement for it.

# What the walk is allowed to prune: the INTERSECTION of what every scanner already skipped, not
# the union. Pruning wider would silently change what those scanners see — measured: pruning with
# mapper's 27-entry list dropped one directory's stored-material count from 774 files to 762,
# because assets never skipped `build/`, `out/` or `tmp/` and suddenly did. A performance change
# that quietly rewrites the map is not a performance change.
#
# So each module keeps its own filter, applied after the walk exactly as before, and this set holds
# only the directories all five agreed on. That is enough: these are the ones that are enormous.
# Directories the walk could not enter, filled by the onerror hook below and reported by
# chamnan-map. A set, because one walk may hit the same parent repeatedly.

# `.svn/pristine` tree is every file in the working copy a second time (R21 agent 5).

    Relative on purpose. Callers do `path.relative_to(root)` with whatever form of the root they
    were given, and `relative_to` raises ValueError when the two forms differ — an unresolved root
    against a resolved path, a symlinked path against its real one. Every caller here treats that
    exception as "skip this file", so returning resolved absolutes silently dropped files instead
    of failing: measured on this repository as 1,145 -> 1,133 in the stored-material section, with
    nothing reported. Storing relatives and re-joining onto the caller's own root cannot drift.

    `.git` is inside SKIP_DIRS and must never be descended into, but mapper needs to know WHERE the
    .git directories are to spot a checkout inside this checkout. os.walk hands us `dirnames`
    before the prune, so both facts come out of the same pass.
