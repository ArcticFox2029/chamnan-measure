"""An inventory of the material that is NOT source — and the reason it belongs in the index.

A platform of any size carries far more payload than code: scanned paperwork, proof-of-delivery
photos, exports, archives, model weights. None of it should ever be read to understand the system,
and chamnan does not read it. The temptation is therefore to say nothing about it at all.

That is the wrong call, and it costs more than it saves. An agent that is told nothing about a
directory does not conclude the directory is unimportant — it goes and looks. One `find` over a
large mount, a `ls` of a few levels, and two or three files opened to see what they are, costs far
more than the forty tokens it takes to say: attachments/nfs holds 12,400 files totalling 4.2 GB,
mostly PDF and PNG, and it is payload rather than source.

So this section exists to STOP exploration, not to enable it. It reports shape only — counts, total
size, the extensions that dominate — and never opens a file. Directories below a threshold are left
out entirely, because a handful of images beside a README is not a mount and saying so is noise.
