"""What is connected to what — the half of a repository that reading one file does not tell you.

The Quick Index answers "what exists". This answers "what breaks if I change this", which is the
question actually asked before an edit.

Deliberately one-directional in emphasis. A file's own imports are already visible at the top of
that file, so listing them again buys little. What a reader cannot get without searching is the
REVERSE edge — who depends on this — and which tests cover it. So that is what this section leads
with, and it is why the output is a fraction of the size a full dependency listing would be.

Not a dependency graph. There is no database, no transitive closure and no cycle analysis:
one hop, capped, per file. Anything deeper is a question for a real static-analysis tool, and
pretending otherwise would cost the index its size advantage for an answer it cannot be trusted on.

Cost. Imports are collected by mapper.scan() while it already has each file's source in hand, so
there is no second read of the repository. Building the reverse map is one pass over the edges,
not a comparison of every file against every other — linear in edges, not quadratic in files.
Measured on a 2,365-file polyglot corpus, the whole map including this section takes about the same
time it did without it.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------- reading it back
# `render()` above is the only writer of this section, and the two patterns below are its exact
# inverse. They are a pair: a round-trip test feeds render()'s own output straight back into
# parse_section(), so changing the format breaks that test rather than silently breaking every
# query built on it.
#
# Why parse markdown at all, rather than keep a JSON sidecar: a full rescan of the repository this
# plugin is developed against measured 64 seconds, which is not a thing to do on an interactive
# question, and a second machine-readable artifact would be another file to regenerate, prune and
# keep in sync. "Markdown is the truth" is a standing constraint here, and this honours it — the
# rendered section IS the index, and this reads it.
