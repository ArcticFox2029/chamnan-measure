"""Rules that a tool can verify, instead of rules the model has to keep remembering.

Instruction adherence decays. Models are measured 39% worse and 112% less reliable in multi-turn
settings than on the same task single-turn (Laban et al. 2025), and adherence to an instruction
given in an earlier turn falls monotonically with turn count -- o1-preview from 88% to 71% between
the first and third turn on Multi-IF. The decay shape differs by model (linear for claude-sonnet-4,
exponential for others) but the direction does not.

A rule injected once at session start is exactly the instruction those studies measure decaying. The
engineering answer is not to inject it harder. It is to stop relying on the model remembering, and
have something check the repository instead.

So a rule may carry an optional trailer:

    **Check:** present `PATTERN` in `GLOB`
    **Check:** absent `PATTERN` in `GLOB`
    **Check:** present `PATTERN` in every `GLOB`
    **Check:** absent `PATTERN` in every `GLOB`

PATTERN is a plain regular expression and GLOB is a path pattern relative to the repository root.
Without `every`, both are AGGREGATE across the whole glob: `present` is upheld while at least one
file matches, `absent` while none do. With `every`, they are per-file: `present ... in every`
requires each file to match and `absent ... in every` requires none of them to, and the failure
message names the files rather than a count. Say `every` whenever the rule means "each one" -- the
aggregate form will report a violated per-file invariant as holding, which is the trap this grammar
word exists to remove.

`present` means the rule is upheld while at least one match exists; `absent` means it is upheld
while none does. A rule with no Check is unchanged and unaffected -- most rules are about judgement
and cannot be reduced to a grep, which is the reason this is optional and always will be.

Deliberately narrow. It reports; it never edits, and it never fails a command. A rule whose check
cannot run (bad pattern, glob matching nothing) is reported as UNVERIFIABLE rather than as broken,
because "I could not check" and "this is violated" are different facts and collapsing them is how a
check becomes noise that gets ignored.

# natural way, "every service config declares a timeout" became
# ``**Check:** present `timeout:` in `config/*.yaml` ``; adding a second config with no timeout at
# all, the exact regression the rule exists to prevent, still reported `holds — 1/2 file(s)`,
# because one OTHER file matched (R8 agent 3, 2026-09-06). This module's own docstring says collapsing "I could
# not check" into "this is violated" is how a check becomes noise; collapsing "violated" into
# "holds" is the same failure and worse, and it had no name here.
#
# `in every GLOB` is the per-file quantifier. The aggregate form is unchanged, so no existing rule
# moves; a rule author who means "each one" can now say it, and the BROKEN message names the files
# that fail rather than a count they have to go and diff themselves.

    Containment is checked here rather than trusted from the glob. `Path.glob()` follows `..`
    segments, so a rule whose Check trailer read ``in `../../../../etc/hosts` `` read a real file
    outside the repository and reported its match count into the session -- a working oracle for
    any file the process can open, from a rule file that arrives with a clone. It bypassed
    redact's never-open list too, which is why that is consulted as well: this module is the one
    place a path in repository text turns into an open().

    \U0001f41b [2026-09-07] This was inline in `_matches`, and `run()` built its human-readable
    OFFENDERS list from a SECOND, raw `Path(root).glob(glob)` that never came near it. The two calls
    glob the same string and were not the same computation: this one filters, that one only removed
    files already in `missing` -- a set that by construction cannot hold a file this filter
    excluded, because it was dropped before `missing` existed. So a rule that could not READ outside
    the repository could still NAME outside it, and the line those names land in is printed OUTSIDE
    the `[repo:nonce]` fence, in chamnan's own voice. It does not need a `..` pattern either: a
    committed symlinked directory plus an ordinary in-repo glob is enough, because `Path.glob`
    follows a symlinked directory for its one-level children. It also silently disagreed about
    MAX_FILES. One function, two callers, which is the only way the two stay the same computation.
