"""Session records — where the last piece of work stopped, so the next one does not restart it.

Distinct from STATE.md on purpose, and the distinction is worth holding onto because the two will
otherwise drift into duplicates of each other:

    STATE.md   ONE file, overwritten. "What is true about this repo's work right now."
    sessions/  MANY files, append-only. "Where the session on the 14th got to, and what it left."

STATE.md answers a question about the present. A session record answers a question about a
particular stretch of work — and the only part of it anybody needs at the start of the next
session is the part that was not finished.

One file per session rather than one growing log, because these files live in a git repository and
get written on branches. Many small files merge cleanly; a single append-only document conflicts
every time two branches both worked a day.

Nothing here writes: Claude writes the record, through skills/resume. A hook cannot, because a hook
has no access to what the session was about -- chamnan_session_end.py can see which scripts repeated and
nothing else. So this module reads, selects, and prunes, and the format below is the contract
between the skill that writes and the hook that reads.
