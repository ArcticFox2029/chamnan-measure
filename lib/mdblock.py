"""Reading markdown structure out of text that a person -- or an agent -- wrote freely.

Four modules in this package find their structure by scanning for lines that start with `#`:
session records split on `##`, milestones and environments parse entries back out of one appended
file, and memory demotes an entry's own headings before injecting it. Every one of them was a
plain per-line regex, and a plain per-line regex cannot tell a heading from a line of a fenced
code block that happens to begin with `#` -- which is what a shell comment, a Python comment and
a markdown example all look like.

That is not cosmetic in this package, because the results are injected. A `## Done` section whose
body quoted a snippet containing `## Remaining` parsed as two sections, and `carry_forward()` --
which is read at the top of the next session -- delivered the fabricated one and silently dropped
the real section that followed it. The same gap in reverse let a milestone title carrying a
newline write a second, complete-looking milestone into the file underneath the real one.

So: `fenced_lines` for reading, `one_line` for writing. Both are deliberately small. A markdown
parser is not being added to a plugin whose whole deployment story is the standard library.
