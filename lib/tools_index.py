"""`.chamnan/tools/index.json` — the registry `chamnan-promote` writes and chamnan_session_start.py reads.

Extracted out of `bin/chamnan-promote` so a second writer (`chamnan-candidates promote`, which
installs a tool skeleton from a confirmed candidate rather than copying an existing script) reuses
the exact same read/append/format logic instead of a second, slightly different copy of it. Two
JSON-append implementations drifting apart is exactly the kind of bug this repo has been burned by
before with concurrent writers of a shared file — see `main_app_concurrent_file_writes.md` in the
repo this plugin is developed against, though that specific failure mode (two threads writing at
once) does not apply here, since every caller is a short-lived CLI invocation, never long-running.

The schema is deliberately small: `name`, `desc`, `added` (ISO timestamp), `origin` (where the
content came from — a file path for a promoted script, `"candidate:<slug>"` for one generated from
a detected sequence), `runs` (a usage counter `record_call()` increments on every matched Bash
call and `usage()` reads back for `chamnan-report`'s Usage section), `interrupted` and
`stderr_seen` (Stage 10's two honest signals, below).

**There is no exit code to track, and this module does not pretend otherwise.** Confirmed against
another installed plugin's own comment stating the exact fact twice over: a Bash `tool_response`
carries only `stdout`, `stderr` and `interrupted` — never a numeric status. `record_call()` counts
the two signals that ARE real: `interrupted` (the call was killed or timed out — an unambiguous
fact) and `stderr_seen` (the call wrote to stderr at all — a WEAK signal, since plenty of correct
commands write progress or warnings there too). Neither is reported as "the tool failed"; both are
reported as exactly what they are, and a human reading a flag decides what it means. This is the
same discipline Stage 8's promotion classifier already applies to itself: state the real signal and
its limits, never invent a confidence number to paper over not having one.

FLAG_AT = 3

# 🐛 [2026-09-04] `stderr_seen` no longer raises the flag, and this is the measurement that took it
# out. `runs` and `stderr_seen` were EQUAL for every tool in a real workspace:

#     extract_findings.py     runs=5  stderr_seen=5
#     silent_probe.py         runs=1  stderr_seen=1   <- its entire body is print("ok")
#
# A script whose only statement writes one line to stdout cannot produce stderr, and it was counted
# anyway. So in at least one shipped harness the `stderr` field of a Bash `tool_response` is never
# empty -- it appears to carry the host's own trailing notice, not the command's output -- and the
# counter is a constant, not a signal. Every promoted tool crossed the threshold on its third run
# and was reported as "worth a look" for behaving correctly.
#
# The docstring above called it "a WEAK signal". Weak would be survivable. A constant is worse: it
# fires on everything, which trains a reader to ignore the notice, which costs the `interrupted`
# signal beside it -- and that one IS real, because a killed or timed-out call is an unambiguous
# fact the harness genuinely reports.
#
# It is still COUNTED, and still printed by chamnan-report, because the number is evidence about
# the harness and someone should be able to see it. It just cannot raise an alarm on its own.

    """Names in the index whose tool FILE is not in `tools/` — registered, and read by nothing.

    A registration and a file are two separate things, and `chamnan-candidates demote` is the only
    path that removes both. Delete `.chamnan/tools/some-tool.py` by hand and the entry stays, with
    its run counter, describing a file that is gone.

    \U0001f41b [2026-09-10] THREE readers of this index answer a person, and only two of them
    filtered these out. The SessionStart hook drops them, `chamnan-promote --list` prints
    `← no such file in tools/; ignored by sessions` and counts them in its summary — and
    `chamnan-report`'s "Promoted tools" section printed them as ordinary rows at `0 runs`,
    indistinguishable from a real tool nobody uses and therefore worth demoting. Two of its other
    counters had the same gap. The root `CLAUDE.md` names that command as how to answer "is chamnan
    worth keeping", so a phantom row there is the expensive kind of wrong (R1 agent 5, 2026-09-10, finding 5).

    The predicate lives HERE rather than being copied to a third caller: this module owns
    `index.json`, so it is the one place that can answer what an entry refers to. `ws.inside` is
    part of the question, not decoration — a name that escapes the workspace is not a tool of ours
    however real the file it names.

    The one predicate behind three callers that each used to carry their own copy — the SessionStart
    hook's `_real_tool`, `chamnan-promote --list`, and `missing_files` above. They agreed, which is
    the only reason nothing had gone wrong yet; the report that found this saw one reader missing the
    check and not that the check existed three times (R1 agent 5, 2026-09-10, finding 5).

    Three things, and every caller needs all three:

      * the entry names something that can BE a filename — `safe_tool_name` refuses a path-shaped
        or device-shaped name, and a name stays valid in the index after the file is gone;
      * the file is there;
      * and it is inside the workspace, so a name that escapes is not a tool of ours however real
        the file it points at.

    Returns the VALIDATED name rather than True: the hook writes it back over the raw field before
    printing, and a predicate that answered yes/no would leave that caller normalising by hand.
